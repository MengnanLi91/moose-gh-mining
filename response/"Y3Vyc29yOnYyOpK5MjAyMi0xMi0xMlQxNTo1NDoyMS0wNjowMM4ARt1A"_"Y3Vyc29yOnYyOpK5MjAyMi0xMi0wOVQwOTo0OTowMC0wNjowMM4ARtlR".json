If that is true, then the weak form is encoded in the https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/TimeDerivative.html and https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/ConservativeAdvection.html Kernels (along with any BCs that are appropriate for you).   You don't need to code any C++ to solve the advection equation using MOOSE: just use those two in-built Kernels.\nIf you've trying to solve du/dt + v.grad(u) = 0, where u is your Variable and v is a known vector field, then first note that this is not the advection equation.  I suggest writing this as du/dt + div(vu) - u div(v) = 0.  Then the first two terms are the advection equation, and are encoded as described in the last paragraph, while the final term can be described using https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/CoefReaction.html (but div(v) has to be a constant) or https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/MatReaction.html (you'd have to create a Material version of your Function)",

Surely, I can make it in 3D with the point source in the middle but it would be much more efficient to move to an axial symmetric model with a point source at the z-axis. Unfortunately, whenever I try to place a point source at the z-axis the resulting acoustic waves are strange and incorrect. Is there an easy way around this?\nThanks!",

In cartesian coordinates the dirac kernel works in the following way: consider the integral \\int_\\Omega w s \\delta(x-x0) dV, where \\Omega is the entire domain, w is the test function, s is your point source, and \\delta is the dirac delta function with the spike at x0. The integrand gets sifted out and you get w(x0) s(x0) JxW in the assembly process. The issue comes up when you do the coordinate transformation for rz, where the integral becomes \\int_\\Omega w s \\delta(x-x0) 2 \\pi r dV. Now, when this gets sifted out, it becomes zero because r = 0 along the symmetry axis. To get around this, you either need to use a crazily refined mesh (which can get rid of the noisy waves, but you are still relying on numerical integration error), or change the point source to a well defined volumetric source defined around the neighborhood of that point.\nThe ADMatDiffusion doesn't account for rz coordinates. The correct residual should be the following one. You can just use the ADCoefMatDiffusion we have in raccoon.\n\nI tested this using the following input file, it works fine without further refinement:\n[Mesh]\n  type = GeneratedMesh\n  dim = 2\n  xmin = 0\n  xmax = 3\n  ymin = 1\n  ymax = 4\n  nx = 100\n  ny = 100\n[]\n\n[Problem]\n  coord_type = RZ\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [p]\n  []\n[]\n\n[Kernels]\n  [inertia_p]\n    type = InertialForce\n    variable = p\n  []\n  [diff_p]\n    type = ADCoefMatDiffusion\n    variable = p\n    prop_names = 'D'\n  []\n  [source_p]\n    type = ADCoefMatSource\n    variable = p\n    prop_names = 's'\n    coefficient = -1\n  []\n[]\n\n[Functions]\n  [s_func]\n    type = ParsedFunction\n    value = 'r:=sqrt(x^2+(y-1.75)^2); if(t<0.1,if(r<0.25,5e-4,0),0)'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Materials]\n  [density]\n    type = GenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'density'\n    prop_values = '444.44'\n  []\n  [diff]\n    type = ADGenericConstantMaterial\n    prop_names = 'D'\n    prop_values = '1000'\n  []\n  [source]\n    type = ADGenericFunctionMaterial\n    prop_names = 's'\n    prop_values = 's_func'\n  []\n[]\n\n[Executioner]\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = NEWTON\n  petsc_options_iname = '-pc_type'\n  petsc_options_value = 'lu'\n  nl_rel_tol = 1e-6\n  nl_abs_tol = 1e-8\n  end_time = 2.1\n  dt = 1.5e-3\n  [TimeIntegrator]\n    type = NewmarkBeta\n  []\n[]\n\n[Outputs]\n  exodus = true\n  print_linear_residuals = false\n[]",

The transient positions of those particles are stored in a vector format, something like the following:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{X}[i, t] \\\\\n\\mathrm{Y}[i, t] \\\\\n\\mathrm{Z}[i, t] \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the index of the particle and $t$ stands for the timestep. Such a system with 4 particles can be seen in the screenshot below, where the 4 particles change their position with every timestep. The transient positions of these particles will be stored as explained above, $\\mathrm{X}[{i =1..4}, t={1..3} ], \\mathrm{Y}[{i =1..4}, t={1..3} ], \\mathrm{Z}[{i =1..4}, t={1..3} ]$\n\nI need your kind help in visualising the trajectory of these particles as shown in the following screenshot. Could you please help me by suggesting a tool or method to visualise these transient trajectories in MOOSE?",

Mac lazily checks for undefined symbols during run-time and apparently sometimes doesn't give detailed info about what's missing.\nI'm very glad you were able to get it worked out though!",
