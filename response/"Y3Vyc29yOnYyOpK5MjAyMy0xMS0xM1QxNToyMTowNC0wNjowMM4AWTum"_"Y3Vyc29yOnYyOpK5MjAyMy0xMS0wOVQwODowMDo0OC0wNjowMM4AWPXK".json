          "bodyText": "Hi there,\nI am wondering how MOOSE handles gauge invariance. When solving a set of problems that has gauge variance should the user select a predefined gauge to work within, or will gauge invariance be handled by the test function?\nAnd subsequently, should the user define a gauge, will this affect the results/convergence of the kernels due to some interaction with the test function?\nThis might be one that @cticenhour might know the answer to.\nAny help would be much appreciated!\nMany thanks,\nGillian",

                  "bodyText": "We don't currently have a model example that applies a gauge and solves for a vector potential in the MOOSE electromagnetics module, as Maxwell's equations are manipulated into coupled wave equations and solved directly for the electric and magnetic vector fields. Adding a Coulomb gauge, in particular, is something that is on my roadmap for the coming months of development for a research project, but isn't ready yet.\nThe gauge invariance isn't handled by the test function. We use a first-order Nedelec vector basis from libMesh for most problems, and the recent introduction of Raviart-Thomas elements in libMesh is something I also want to explore. So, if you wanted to attempt to define a gauge in your problem, the test function should not affect the results or convergence (at least in a way specific to the gauge, I believe). @lindsayad or @roystgnr may be able to give some insight on the libMesh test functions and correct me if I am wrong here.",

It might be wise to stop reading this comment after that sentence.\nIs the idea here that we're solving for a divergence-free vector field like the magnetic field B, and \u2207\u00b7B=0 implies that there exists a potential-vector field A such that B=\u2207\u00d7A, so we'd like to be able to just solve for A directly and get a strongly divergence-free B, but the problem is that A is only unique up to some transformation (like adding \u2207\u03a9 for some smooth \u03a9) that changes A but not B?\nIf you're solving a problem like that in 2D, you can use a variable defined with one of the libMesh C\u00b9 scalar-valued elements (CLOUGH works on general grids; HERMITE is more efficient if you have a cartesian mesh), treat its values as if they were magnitudes of a vector field in the z direction, take the curl of that field to get a divergence-free vector field in the xy plane, and the kernel of that operation is just the constant fields so you can add a single extra residual term to pin the value at one point to get a well-defined potential.\nIf you're solving a problem like that in 3D, you could still use three HERMITE variables to give you components of a C\u00b9 vector field, and take the curl of that to get a divergence-free 3D vector field ... but now the kernel isn't a simple one-dimensional thing, it's dimensionality is something like a third of your degrees of freedom.  Maybe there's some efficient way to constrain that and keep going, but when I looked at that problem during my PhD I was advised to find something easier instead.",

          "bodyText": "Hi, I want to understand how the interface kernel system works, as I have custom normal flux conditions as well as tangential flux conditions to implement.\nUNDERSTANDING InterfaceKernels System using SideSetHeatTransferKernel as an example:\nFor an interface as described in the documentation (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/interfacekernels/SideSetHeatTransferKernel.html), the heat flux on either side of the interface should be equivalent. Considering only conduction for now, we have:\n\nI looked through the file to see how it was implemented and I was wondering some things:\n1.  How is q defined? the relationship q = -k\u2207T is strongly imposed in both heat conduction kernels. That is, this expression is directly substituted in the ADHeatConduction kernel, basically eliminating q from the Heat Equation (writing it all in terms of T). So, how does MOOSE know that q refers to the gradient of temperature multiplied by the thermal conductivity? Even in the BC system, if we prescribe q for a Neumann BC, how does it know that the value defined needs to be scaled by the thermal conductivity at that point to relate it to our temperature variable? Because as far as MOOSE is concerned, q itself doesn't really exist, the both variables and Heat Equation are written entirely in terms of Temperature.\nAsking because in the custom formulation I want to implement, q is not strongly connected to Temperature by a simple gradient, it is weakly enforced through kernels that include both q and T (i.e the \"Heat Equation\" contains both q and T terms i.e q is its own variable), unlike here where q was completely eliminated by a direct substitution.\n2. Where is q in the interface condition implementation? Given the definition of the condition (conduction alone), we should have that q_var + C*(T_var - T_neighbor) = 0; and q_neighbor + C*(T_var - T_neighbor) = 0. Looking through the SideSetHeatTransferKernel Source file:\n  if (_cond[_qp] != 0.0) // Conduction\n  {\n    Real jump = _u[_qp] - _neighbor_value[_qp];\n    switch (type)\n    {\n      case Moose::Element:\n        r += _cond[_qp] * jump * _test[_i][_qp];\n        break;\n\n      case Moose::Neighbor:\n        r -= _cond[_qp] * jump * _test_neighbor[_i][_qp];\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n\nIn the above, jump =_u[_qp] - _neighbor_value[_qp] is equivalent to (T_var - T_neighbor). I also see that the FE discretization was done twice, for the two cases (i.e _test and _test_neighbor being the test functions multiplied for each case). The only thing that seems to be \"missing\" is q for each case. Is it automatically assumed that q is added to this for InterfaceKernels? And if so, that brings me back to question 1- how is q defined? As far as MOOSE is concerned, q does not exist, as all the kernels are written COMPLETELY in terms of temperature.\n3. What component of q is this being implemented for? In the BC system, it is the normal component of the flux. I looked through the NeumannBC source file and found:\n{\n  return -_test[_i][_qp] * _value;\n}\n\nSo my guess is that with [_i] its somehow applying it to the normal component. I couldn't find elsewhere in the file where _i was defined, though.\nI ask because I want to implement different interface conditions for the NORMAL component and TANGENTIAL component. So, in my interface condition file, I need to be able to specify that it applies only to the specific components of q I need. Basically, how can I define unit tangent and normal vectors at a boundary so I can multiply my q vector by them?",

It's just how the numerics of the finite element scheme workout. You have to write out your weak form and identify what terms have been integrated by parts. Often it is only the diffusion or conduction portion of the equation, in which case your surface term is <test, n * -k * grad T>. If you don't apply any boundary condition or interface kernel, then you are weakly setting n * -k * grad T = 0. If you write one BC with residual <test, A>, another boundary condition with residual <test, B>, then you will be weakly setting n * -k * grad T = A + B\n\nThen how could a case where the discontinuities are not related by the flux be implemented? For this case, what if , instead of q_var + C*(T_var - T_neighbor) = 0, you had C*(T_var - T_neighbor) + CONSTANT = 0?\n\nHopefully you have at least some term that is integrated by parts? You could implement this condition using a penalty method (or in theory a Lagrange multiplier but that takes some more work). You could write a residual that is <test, penalty * (C * (T - Tn) - CONSTANT)>. The larger the penalty factor the more closely you would require your condition to be met. Note that this will still weakly enforce a condition: flux = penalty * (C * (T - Tn) - CONSTANT)\n\nI'm asking because in my case, q and T are both independent variables weakly related through kernels I implemented.

That is, does MOOSE work backwards based on what you provide as the kernel to get what the BC term should be like? In the case where nothing was integrated by parts (and hence, no grad_test kernel term), how does MOOSE know what the Neumann condition should be like? Will it just be a derivative of the u term?\n\nAs for the implementation of the custom interface condition, if I use a kernel with a penalty, since it involves two variables that are defined only on separate blocks, will MOOSE only try to implement it at the interface where both variables are defined?

As a NodalBC this would be pretty difficult. You cannot use a material property in an aux kernel that runs on nodes. Similarly you could not use an elemental variable or a material property directly in a NodalBC.\n\nFor any of this to work, can I define boundary conditions that depend on a variable? That is, the variables coupled within my material file used to calculate the BC.\n\nYou can use any kind of variable in an IntegratedBC or InterfaceKernel. You can only use C0 family variables (e.g. Lagrange) in NodalBCs",

Even if you didn't have to worry about library regressions (for which I do apologize) this would be an important thing to have to check for bugs at higher levels.\nI'll add your files to the unit test suite (in additional commits to libMesh/libmesh#3699) so we can at least avoid regressions this gross in the future; thanks very much for the contribution.  I'll mention that they were ABAQUS-generated in the comments there.\nAnd I might be able to come up with something to get better testing than my first crack of \"does this load; do the node and element counts match\".

Git is complex, no argument there! I make mistakes all the time. And some of gits naming conventions don't help. Also, I believe you are attempting to rebase from the wrong remote. origin should be upstream if you are applying updates and if you also have your own github account hosting a fork of moose (which I believe you do).\nCommon workflow practice when making and saving new changes:\n1. You need to tell git to track these files, and save them.\n                           ^^^^^ `git add`        ^^^^  `git commit`\n\n2. Optional; once you have saved your work you can also\n             save your work to your github account\n             ^^^^ `git push origin`\n\n3.

          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI started exploring the SIMP omptimization capabilities of MOOSE recently and noticed that the SensitivityFilter only partially behaves the way I'd expect it to or rather how I'm used to. It does prevent checkerboarding and introduces a minimum length scale dependent on the filter radius - as expected. However the boundaries are way clearer than I'd anticipate. For reference, here are two pictures from an optimization with similar setup from ABAQUS and MOOSE with a filter radius of 10 times the element size:\n\n\nThe clearer boundaries from the MOOSE result are instantly noticeable. A straight 0-1-design is considered a good thing, I was just wondering how exactly the MOOSE SensitivityFilter works since I recon it differs from the standard sensitivity filter used here for example. I'm primarily having a hard time understanding the functionality of RadialAverage and the meaning of _JxW[gp]. Maybe the resulting MOOSE filter is one of the ones mentioned here in section 5.2?\nThanks in advance.",

For reference, I used the \"PowerLawCreepStressUpdate\" material as a template to build from.\nThe problem I've been having is that I can't figure out how to update the state variable in a way that 1) updates only when the iteration has converged (i.e., the end of the time-step) and 2) only gets updated once per time-step.\nI've been trying to put it in the \"iterationFinalize\" method but it seems to be updating the variable every iteration rather than once per time-step.\nI did some researching and found a similar discussion (#22195 (comment)). It is mentioned that the damage variable should be updated within the \"computeQpProperties\" method. I can't figure out how to do this (my C++ is very weak, just trying to learn enough to get by at the moment).\nIf you were going to re-implement a computeQpProperties method to the PowerLawCreepStressUpdate material, what would you have to do to the header and the source file to make sure that it still has its previous functionality and add new functionality?\nThank you in advance!",
