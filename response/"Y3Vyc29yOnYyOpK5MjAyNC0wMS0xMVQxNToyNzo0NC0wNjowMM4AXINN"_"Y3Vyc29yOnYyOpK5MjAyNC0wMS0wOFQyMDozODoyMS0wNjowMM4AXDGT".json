          "bodyText": "Hello everyone,\nI am currently employing the DFEM method to solve a problem involving multiple materials, each corresponding to a distinct block. While certain reaction types are exclusive to specific materials, I allocate reaction cross-sections for all reaction types to each material, setting the cross-section value to 0 for non-occurring reaction types.\nAn overflow issue in the output has arisen, as illustrated in the attached image. The image illustrates the occurrence region of a specific reaction type (highlighted in red), which appears larger than the theoretical region (covered in green).\n\nGiven that I am using AuxVariables to track reaction rates, and all operations in AuxKernels are based on quadrature points (_qp), I suspect the issue arises from the presence of quadrature points at the interfaces between different materials. These quadrature points belong to adjacent cells and possess properties of one adjacent material each. Although this doesn't impact the program's calculations, moose will merge data for quadrature points at the same location during output, resulting in non-zero reaction rates for adjacent cells.\nI am using MONOMIAL variables of the first order, and I am unsure about the accuracy of my speculation. If it is, could you please provide guidance on how to address this situation?\nAppreciate your assistance.\nhityyds",

There are also several ongoing projects to develop MOOSE applications for fusion device modeling.\nThe Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) Workshop provides an in-depth introduction to the framework. The course is two days in length and covers material starting from the mathematical underpinnings of the framework through advanced features of the MOOSE Multiapps system. The course uses a realistic multiphysics problem that is solved with increasing realism and complexity utilizing the many pluggable systems in the framework. Hands on exercises are supplied so attendees are encouraged to bring their own hardware to participate. More information about MOOSE can be found on our website.\nThe registration deadline will be flexible but we encourage early registration as space is limited. Please email me for any issue or question with registration.\nFor BISON workshop on January 18-19th:\nThe BISON fuel performance team is hosting a two-day, interactive workshop. This workshop is intended to help prospective users get started with the code, provide an overview of the methods to model specific fuel types, and provide practical examples to help users gain experience. Please forward this message to anyone at your institution interested in BISON, fuel performance modeling, or MOOSE-related software.\nWORKSHOP TOPICS\n\u2022\tIntroduction to thermomechanical fuel performance modeling and multiphysics analysis\n\u2022\tCode development principles and contribution of new models\n\u2022\tOverview of LWR, TRISO, and Metallic fuel capabilities\n\u2022\tMeshing fuel geometries\n\u2022\tSimulation output analysis and visualization\n\u2022\tInteractive practice examples and in-person support\nThe deadline for registration to the BISON workshop is December 1st, 2023. We encourage early registration as space is limited.\nThe sign-up link is at this address for both training. If you want to attend both, you must register twice, once for each training date.\nhttps://ncrcaims.inl.gov/Identity/Account/TrainingRegistration",
