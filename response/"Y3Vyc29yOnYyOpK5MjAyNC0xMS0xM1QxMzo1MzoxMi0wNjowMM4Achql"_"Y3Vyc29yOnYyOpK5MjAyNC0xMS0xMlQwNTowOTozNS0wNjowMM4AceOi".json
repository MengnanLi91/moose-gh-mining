I am performing heat transfer and mechanical calculations for two 3D blocks, with coupled gap distance heat transfer calculation set on two surfaces. These two surfaces have a certain curvature, and the initial gap distance is equal (the two surfaces can be viewed as arcs in the xy-plane, stretched in the z-direction).\nThe initial gap distance is correct; however, when one block undergoes displacement in the z-direction, the gap distance calculation produces errors at certain locations, with the gap nearly exceeding the distance limit. The positions where this occurs are distributed in a ring-like pattern, perpendicular to the z-axis.\nI used NearestNodeDistanceAux to output the gap distance between the two surfaces, but this problem still exists.\nHere are my mesh Settings\n  patch_size = 150\n  patch_update_strategy = iteration\n  partitioner = centroid \n  centroid_partitioner_direction = z\n\nand ThermalContact\n  quadrature = true\n  gap_geometry_type = CYLINDER\n  cylinder_axis_point_1 = '0 0 0'\n  cylinder_axis_point_2 = '0 0 1'\n\nand Executioner\n  type = Transient\n  solve_type = 'PJFNK'\n  petsc_options_iname = '-ksp_gmres_restart -pc_type -pc_hypre_type -pc_hypre_boomeramg_max_iter'\n  petsc_options_value = '201    hypre   boomeramg    4'\n  line_search = 'none'\n  automatic_scaling = true\n  start_time = 0.0\n  end_time = 10\n  dtmax = 1\n\nand contact\n    primary = 1\n    secondary = 2\n    penalty = 1e8\n    formulation = PENALTY\n    model = frictionless\n\nIs there any mistake in my setup or something that needs improvement?",

For the order parameter, it has added the following term in heat equation:  c0 * T * grad(c)* dgrad(c)dt , where c0 is a material property.  And the weak form of this term should be c0 * T * grad(c) * dgrad(c)dt * test_function.\nAnd in MOOSE kernel file, the residual should be _c0[_qp] * _phi[_qp] *_u[_qp] *_grad_v[_qp]*_grad_v_dot[_qp]*_test[_qp].

Initially, c_add is only present in (1-eta) phase and diffused at the interface.\nThe major concern in my result is the non-zero value of c_add in the phase eta after the phase has evolved for sometime. Since dc_add/dt becomes zero in the evolved phase eta, the evolution of c_add becomes zero. However, c_add is non-zero.\nPlease suggest the modification required in my equation. Currently c_add is not coupled with phase field variables. I have found some literatures where c_add is simply multiplied with 1-h to do so but this is rather forcing c_add to zero than some kind of transport.\nThanks\n@laagesen @dschwen @GiudGiud",

I think it would be helpful if the documentation page of TotalLagrangianStressDivergence links to/mention them (also for the spherical case, TotalLagrangianStressDivergenceCentrosymmetricSpherical).\nBut an important thing I just found (maybe it could be included as a warning?) is that in the axisymmetric case, the 2D mesh MUST be created in the x-y domain. I struggled for a while trying to figure out why the 3D and 2D axisymmetric simulations I ran didn't match, but then tried on a whim to create the mesh in the x-y plane (instead of x-z plane as before) and that fixed it.\nWell, I guess there already is some kind of warning, the page on coordinate systems says that the arrangement is r, z, theta, instead of r, theta, z. But I didn't think it was that obvious till I fixed it.",

I am referring to the /mnt path for Cardinal. While this is fine, it may explain why missing libraries can exist; Are you building this on one machine and bringing it to another? FYI, that won't work well. Not unless both machines are identically built.\n\nThe issues you are running into seems to me, being caused by a not-sane environment. We need to clean this up. Because you have OpenMPI installed on the system, I would refrain from using any of our Conda packages, and just stick to using apt-get to install what you need.\nIt looks like the first run of your ./diagnostics.sh was only missing F77 F90 variables:\n# get out of the moose environment\nconda deactivate\nconda activate base\n\n# set variables that the system installed version of OpenMPI is not for some reason:\nexport F77=mpif77 F90=mpif90\n./diagnostics.sh\nBecause you introduced two completely different compiler stacks into the mix, the best thing to do from here (./diagnostics.sh is passing and you are not loading the moose environment), is start completely over.
