          "bodyText": "Hello,\nI have generated a mesh using Cubit, and am currently in the process of writing an input file for Pronghorn (which uses MOOSE modules). The mesh mostly contains triangles (see Figure below).\nI have a list of instruments with positions in Cartesian coordinates, and would like to compare my simulation results (specifically, the variable T_solid) to the experimental data. The problem is that most of the locations of these instruments are not at nodes, nor situated on lines connecting two nodes. The imperfect solution would be to use NearestNodeNumber but it is giving me the following error:\n*** ERROR ***\nA 'NearestNodeNumberUO' is not a registered object.\nIf you are trying to find this object in a dynamically linked library, make sure that\nthe library can be found either in your \"Problem/library_path\" parameter or in the\nMOOSE_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.\nI was wondering what the best approach to this would be, and which postprocessors (or userobjects) I should use, or what the issue is with using 'NearestNodeNumber'.\nThanks,\nJosh",

What Kernel computes v? As far as I can tell you need to compute a mobility property and it's derivatives w.r.t. all coupled variables. The mobility does not appear in the variational derivative in the CH equation, so its derivative w.r.t. to order parameter gradients should not matter, right?\nI also suggest you utilize the DerivativeMaterialInterface to declare and get derivative material properties for better interoperability with the rest of the phase field module.\nIn short, this should be really simple to implement with only a material for computing the mobility and simply using all stock split CH formulation kernels.",

          "bodyText": "My current work focus on modelling a material microstructure on an RVE and eventually embedding the homogenized behaviour of this model on to bigger component models in continuum scale. As a first step i am interested in applying peridoc boundary conditions to this RVE and i was exploring various methods available in MOOSE which can do that job. The AddPeriodicBCAction objects contain straight forward methods to apply this BC, however to my dismay, the results were not on the expected lines. All of the related methods (auto, translation, function transformation) were tried.\nAlternatively i tried an another route in the form of constraints which might as well model the periodic boundary conditions. This however does not allow me to reference the two pairs of edges participating in this model. Seems like the meshgenerator would either want one pair of edges to be defined or definition of \"final_generator\" parameter which i could not understand, especially for this single domain model.\nA look in to the test suite (/test/tests/mortar/periodic-value/gold) suggests that this approach might give closer results, provided we reference the boundaries to be matched correctly. Here is what i received.\n*** ERROR ***\nYour MeshGenerator tree contains multiple possible generator outputs :\n\"master_y and one or more of the following from an independent set: \"master_x, slave_y\"\n\nThis may be due to a missing dependency or may be intentional. Please select the final MeshGenerator in\nthe [Mesh] block with the \"final_generator\" parameter or add additional dependencies to remove the ambiguity.\nAs far my submodel is concerned it is a simple 2D square block with normal displacements constrained in two of the edges and displacement loads applied on the right edge. The application of PBC's must ensure that the displacements on the respective opposite edges are the same and that we get the simlar deformed profiles on these edges. At present i could not get the sort of behaviour one would expect realistically for this kind of model. e.g., similar to the results in the above folder. I really appreciate any suggestion or pointers in this regard, that would provide a solid start to the work. The attached files might give you an insight in to the schematic of the model, input structure and the results obtained so far.\n19072021.zip\nKind regards,\nArun",

This gives enough room for the model to deform in the loading direction preventing the RBM encountered earlier.\n\n\nI hope the BC applied in this manner mimics realistically the response obtained for an infinite body, while integrating the results with larger continuum models.\nKind regards,\nArun",

I found that when I set up the two-particle along x-direction as an initial condition, the simulation itself ran well but I could not see the reaction force/advection velocity from Paraview.\nSince the physics for two-particle sintering should not rely on two-particle orientation for isotropic diffusion, I wanted to know why I could not see the reaction force/advection velocity. Is it ok to use it for two-particle along x-direction? Do I need to change rotation_constant/translation_constant/stiffness_constant?\nThanks very much,\nKaijie",

This is because the GeneralUserObject does not have access to the _factory object or _problem object. I have tried inheriting my object from the Action class as well. But this doesn't really work, lots of compiler errors with multiple functions being defined with GeneralUserObject and Action. I have tried looking at examples in the Geochemistry and chemical reactions modules but they make the user add in the variables themselves. The problem is that in the future i will be needing to add hundreds of species and i don't want the input file to be super long, might switch to an addition input file for that. So my question is: Can we create nonlinear variables and add them to the problem using GeneralUserObjects?\nIf this is not the case, the other idea i had was to create a AddSpeciesAction that takes in my SpeciesDefinition user object as a parameter. It would then iterate though the species and add them as variables. But im not sure how to add parameters of custom types. Is there a way to add parameters of custom types?\nThanks,\nZack",
