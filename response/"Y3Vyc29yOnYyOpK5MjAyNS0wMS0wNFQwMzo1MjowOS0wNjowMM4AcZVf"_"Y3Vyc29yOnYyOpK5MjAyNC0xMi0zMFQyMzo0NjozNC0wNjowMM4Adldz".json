I've got an input file that contains the following:\n[BCs]\n  [load]\n    type = Pressure\n    boundary = top\n    function = load_ramp\n    variable = disp_x\n  []\n  [fix_x]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = bottom\n    value = 0\n    variable = disp_x\n  []\n  [fix_y]\n    type = DirichletBC\n    boundary = bottom\n    value = 0\n    variable = disp_y\n  []      \n[]\n\nBut no displacements occur. If I instead apply the Pressure to disp_y instead of disp_x, or alternatively take out the Pressure block and add a Pressure Action using the same function and boundary, I get the expected behavior, albeit a normal load rather than one applied tangent to the surface.",

Then it would give a BC like the following:\n[periodic_right]\n    type = CoupledVarDirichletBC\n    variable = vel_x\n    boundary = 'right'\n    v = transformed_vel_x\n[]\n\nBut that feels very odd compared to the steps you gave above which makes me think I might be off track here.\nMy input file is here",

The calculation result shows that v is calculated after u is completed.\nBut what I want is that the program can then update some parameter from v, and then repeatedly compute u and v until the ending condition is satisfied.\nI then tried to the cases of execute_on = LINEAR or NONLINEAR, but the convergence was not good.\nSo, I tried changing the u executioner to be Transient, giving it a large num steps, but setting steady_state_detection = true, and execute_on = 'timestep_end'.\nHere, for each time step, u and v will be fully calculated and the parameters will be updated. When satisfies nl_abs_tol, the Transient calculation will be ended, and the calculation speed is also good.\nNext, I will try to implement FP-iterations to solve the problem and have a comparison.\nThank you again.

A while ago, I managed to install some of MOOSE\u2019s dependencies (specifically the Python environment) using conda, and then followed the \u2018Offline Installation\u2019 guide to successfully install MOOSE by running the following command:\n./update_and_rebuild_petsc.sh --skip-submodule-update --with-packages-download-dir=~/projects/downloads || return\n./update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh --skip-submodule-update || return\n./update_and_rebuild_wasp.sh --skip-submodule-update || return\n\nHowever, when I try to install PETSc on a new account using the same method, I encounter the following error:\n*** Building SLEPc ***\nChecking environment... done\nChecking PETSc installation... Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/public3/home/a0s000425/ZhangHu-MOOSE/projects/moose/petsc/arch-moose/externalpackages/slepc-2e87c100eacb3466e83737e0fd6f542957174390/./configure\", line 12, in <module>\n    exec(f.read())\n  File \"<string>\", line 263, in <module>\n  File \"/public3/home/a0s000425/ZhangHu-MOOSE/projects/moose/petsc/arch-moose/externalpackages/slepc-2e87c100eacb3466e83737e0fd6f542957174390/config/packages/petsc.py\", line 226, in Process\n    slepcdate = dateutil.parser.parse(slepc.gitdate)\n  File \"/public3/home/a0s000425/ZhangHu-MOOSE/minforge/envs/moose-py/lib/python3.9/site-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 1368, in parse\n    return DEFAULTPARSER.parse(timestr, **kwargs)\n  File \"/public3/home/a0s000425/ZhangHu-MOOSE/minforge/envs/moose-py/lib/python3.9/site-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 643, in parse\n    raise ParserError(\"Unknown string format: %s\", timestr)\ndateutil.parser._parser.ParserError: Unknown string format: unknown\n**************************ERROR*************************************\nError building SLEPc.\n********************************************************************\ngmake[2]: *** [slepcbuild] Error 1\n**************************ERROR*************************************\n  Error during compile, check arch-moose/lib/petsc/conf/make.log\n  Send it and arch-moose/lib/petsc/conf/configure.log to petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov\n  Having Conda in your shell may have caused this problem, consider turning off Conda.\n********************************************************************\nmake[1]: *** [all] Error 1\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\nThere was an error.
