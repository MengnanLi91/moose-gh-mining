          "bodyText": "I am performing large 2D (2400X2400 mesh and 20K grains) and 3D (192X192X192, 10K grains) simulations. I am using  GrainTracker block from grain_growth_2D_graintracker.i\n\n[./grain_tracker]\ntype = GrainTracker\nthreshold = 0.2\nconnecting_threshold = 0.08\ncompute_halo_maps = true # Only necessary for displaying HALOS\n[../]\n\nWhen I was analyzing microstructure evolution, I noticed that two grains represented by  a same OP are merging (Grain coalescence) into one. A typical example is here:\n\nThis is happening for many grains.\nEarlier I had similar issue and I observed this issue even for small system size and small number of grains (600 grains). One animation is shown here:\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31565781/114320915-95391a80-9b18-11eb-90ab-4cfc3e363778.mp4\nAt that time, I tried few options like 1) Increase mesh size; 2) Play with  threshold  and connecting_threshold  parameters; 3) increase OPs. But these steps were not helpful. When I used a)  coloring_algorithm = bt and int_width=8 in the PolycrystalVoronoi block then it helped a lot.  Unfortunately, for large scale simulations, these two parameters have other effects like a) increase memory requirement and b) the 'projecting initial condition' step during initialization takes several hours (with 560 cores). It becomes worse for 60K grains in 2D and 20K grains in 3D. So I changed back these parameters (coloring_algorithm = jp and int_width=0 - it resulted in 7.5 times improvement in speed for projecting initial condition). Later, I tried to use Adaptivity  option but that was not useful in this case. Also adaptivity option takes several hours (with 560 cores) for large number of grains.\nIf you have some suggestions or tips then please let me know.\nThank you.",

Why shouldn't the grains coalesce?\nIn my research, I am only considering curvature driven grain growth. In ideal grain growth, boundary migration occurs only due to curvature of the boundary. Growth of grains by  grains coalesce step is unphysical in an ideal grain growth.\nDo you have remapping set to true?\nYes. Default option is true. I did not touch the original GrainTracker block given above.\nWhat does the halos map look like? \nHere is the halos map\n\nMaybe create a small problem to reproduce/explain the issue.\nMy research involves large number of grains (>100K). I started with small system size and I managed to avoid grain coalescence for smaller cases. However, for large simulations, the parameter selected by me (as explained above) takes longer time to reach to t=0 step. So, I went back to default options to save time. I am not sure if solution for small size will work for large system.",

This often happens in polycrystals. However, if this is only happening because the two grains are represented by the same order parameters, then it could be a numerical issue. Probably, the remapping is not working properly. You might consider changing the threshold values or using a different seed for the initial condition.",

          "bodyText": "Hi, moose experts.\nUsually transient algorithms are more stable than steady ones in CFD, but I have encountered a problem that the steady state can converge but the transient cannot converge.\nThis is a 2D problem. There is a solid rectangular inner heat source with two rectangular channels on both sides through which liquid flows to conduct heat. The boundary conditions are inlet temperature, inlet velocity and outlet pressure, as well as the presence or absence of slip boundary conditions at the solid-liquid interface(the velocity is 0 at the boundaries of the flow channels).\n\nI ran a steady state simulation first, and the simulation was converging.\n\nBut when I added a time term to each of the three equations, the simulation didn't converge. The time step of the transient simulation is 1e-6s.\n\nTo describe the problem more clearly, I put the steady-state and transient input files here. The only difference between steady state and transient is the addition of a time term to the transient Kernels block.\nSTEADY\n[Mesh]\n  file = '2layers_2d.msh'\n[]\n\n[Variables]\n  [./T]\n
