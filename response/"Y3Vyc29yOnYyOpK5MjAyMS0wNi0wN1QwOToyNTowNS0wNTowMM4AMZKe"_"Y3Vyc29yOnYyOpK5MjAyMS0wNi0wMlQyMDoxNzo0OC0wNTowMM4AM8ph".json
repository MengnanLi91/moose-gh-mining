          "bodyText": "Dear MOOSE team,\nI have few general questions regarding the coupling between phase field and tensor mechanics:\nBy default, a single phase field simulation uses Eulerian/spatial meshes that don't deform, while a single tensor mechanics simulation uses Lagrangian/material meshes that will deform. When they are coupled together, which mesh type is used?\nIf the material meshes are used, how do we think about the mass conservation in a coupled RVE? For instance, if we have solid and gas phases in a RVE, the solid will flow in/out of the domain due to the mass diffusion, thus the total mass can not be conserved inside the RVE, which gives problem justifying the mass periodicity at the boundary.\nIf spatial meshes are used, how do the meshes deform? Or how do phase field variables influence the traction at the boundary?\nHope you could give me some insights/hints to the questions. Thanks in advance.\nBest regards,\nHao",

The diffusional interface is by default a Lagrangian problem, but to formulate and track this interface this would be very cumbersome and time consuming. Whereas phase field approach bring this problem into Eulerian description and avoid tracking the interface specifically. Please correct me if my thoughts are off somewhere...\n@jiangwen84 I noticed  use_displaced_mesh can be used in tensor mechanics, but not sure how this will affect the coupling.\nMy key problem is in thinking through how the phase field simulation can change the RVE volume via diffusion and advection, i.e., boundaries deforms according to phase field variables, such that I don't need to think of remeshing every timestep to find where the boundary sits, then we could evaluate properties with the right RVE volume. Then I got stuck in this Eulerian-Lagrangian RVE setting...",

If I consider free sintering without external load in a periodic RVE, there are in general two ways to achieve densification: 1. fix domain and let mass flow into this domain at the boundary; 2. keep total solid mass constant and shrink the total domain volume. As material will flow/move inside the domain due to diffusion and advection, the domain boundary should also move accordingly. This is where I got into Eulerian-Lagrangian settings of the RVE. But you pointed out in general the phase-field does not change the volume, would it still be possible to achieve densification using the phase-field method?",

In the first two papers, the mechanical loads are applied to the boundary with prescribed displacements instead of the traction boundary with fixed loads, the solid and void phases are lumped together like a composite material and the composite elasticity tensor is used in the mechanical equilibrium calculation. If one uses the stress at the boundary instead, would it lead to some convergence problem like mesh distortion as void phase has very low elasticity so they could not carry any loads? In your second paper, the last figure with 2 particles deforming in 3D looks very nice, but they deform so much at the end and would small deformation assumption still be valid there?\nThe last paper gives a good overview on the density evaluation methods during sintering, the MC algorithm to evaluate the relative density seems to be a good approach. But all the methods need a post-process step and seem difficult to correlate to homogenization. If one wants to shrink the domain with a global strain that corresponds to local particle movements, how would you suggest to achieve this in MOOSE?",

If the void stiffness is very small, the deformation on void elements will be much larger than on solid phase, or in other words, void phase could not take any loads, only solid phase can, how is the problem overcome in this setting? Maybe I misunderstood how the two phase composite works in mechanical module...\nThe second paper looks very promising, is there a way to correlate particle rigid body motion to the GlobalStrain? Because in all the paper it clearly stated that rigid body motion is the key point to the volume shrinkage during sintering... If this feature is not there, maybe I could contribute in developing it, then I probably will need more help/guidance from the expert like you.",

However , these types of hydraulic gradients are always observed in nature.  This is usually because of some sort of recharge that is happening at y=-big (in your model) - often in some nearby mountain range - and discharge that is happening at y=big (in your model) - often in a valley or floodplain or ocean, etc - along with an aquitard \"cap\" in the model domain that prevents vertical movement of water to the topography.\nTo get this initial condition in a model can be difficult or hard, depending on how you approach the problem.  You can take the hard route by extending your model domain so it includes the recharge and discharge points, and running a sequence of models with different recharge/discharge and hydraulic properties until your model matches observations.  This is possibly the \"best\" type of modelling approach since it most strongly suggests you've got a model that reflects reality.  However, doing the calibration to observation is rather time consuming, and often when you extend the model you're encountered with a bunch of unknowns, which makes your model \"weaker\" since you have to somehow prescribe hydraulic properties, lithologies, recharge zones, etc, that you don't know anything much about.\nInstead, you often simply fix the BCs such that the steady-state matches your observations, without worrying too much about why or how those boundary conditions arise.  Of course, this would be inappropriate if the observations have been influenced by recent water abstractions (in this case, the BCs might be simple hydrostatic, but the ICs would be what you describe).  In MOOSE, you could useFunctions to define these BCs and ICs.  I often use a ParsedFuntion, and always try to use only 1 or a small number of such Functions (e.g. use the same function in all BCs and ICs).  Throughout the aquifers you can assume hydrostatic, unless it disagrees with observations.  These hydrostatic lines \"jump\" as you go through the aquitards.   I hope you understand what i mean: as you move vertically the porepressure (or head) looks like a lightning bolt: \u26a1 .\na",

I have some notes on it at the office but since we are working from home I don't have access to it. If I remember right, the problem comes from an error in how Dream3D writes data out. As you see in grain_size10.txt, it puts the data points on x=-32, y=-32 etc. This sits right on top of the boundaries of the elements, which is what the error message is saying. I believe I was able to work around this by changing X_MIN, Y_MIN, Z_MIN, X_MAX, Y_MAX, Z_MAX manually in the text file so they did not align exactly with the locations of the data points.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/idaholab/moose/discussions/17440*discussioncomment-545492__;Iw!!KGKeukY!nbFVmDHLvuy-J5BfPP6MHX1pdtZkkM9DBTc1X_w_ZHIVPW7RNqFDw4JBf3LLO9tEmSWCg-_A2KI$>, or unsubscribe<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AIUJ4LMJL6PJYNWQ46V2JCDTGDOKTANCNFSM4Z5R2KZQ__;!!KGKeukY!nbFVmDHLvuy-J5BfPP6MHX1pdtZkkM9DBTc1X_w_ZHIVPW7RNqFDw4JBf3LLO9tEmSWClIk2Ic8$>.",

The person who added this input file no longer works at INL so I'm afraid it might not be that easy to track down this reference.\nThe error you are getting indicates you need to update your PetSC library and likely MOOSE as well.",
