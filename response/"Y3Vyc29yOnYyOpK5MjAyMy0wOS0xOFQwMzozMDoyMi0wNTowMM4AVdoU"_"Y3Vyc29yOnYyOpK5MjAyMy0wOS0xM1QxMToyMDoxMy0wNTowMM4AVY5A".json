It took about 25 minutes to build.\nI am trying to run it with ./run_tests -j 1 and it has been going for about 30 minutes. Still printing out OK or SKIP, and I assume it will eventually finish successfully.\nI assume the long wait time is because test likely goes through many cases to ensure that MOOSE is working as expected, and that most code I will write will not take as long.\nDo you know where I can find documentation on the differences between -j1, -j6, -j... etc? I'm new to MOOSE and WSL so I am not sure what this means or where it comes from.\nEditing to say it just finished after 1628.5 seconds.",

If I have understood correctly, as of now, the mesh is generated only once, at the start of the problem, and can't be re-created. I tried to use the reset_apps option in FullSolveMultiApp but following a previous discussion, and also in my experience, that doesn't seem to work. Is there any other way to re-generate the mesh at every Forward call?\nThanks!",

I actually just created some new variables, made them can be output. These variables don't influence the calculation of previous codes. But that change makes computation very slow and can't converge when the load goes after 5% of strain. Do you know how to improve it, make it faster and converge? Below is my codes and input files: https://github.com/pshen20127/Test.git\nThanks\nPshen",

I'd recommend going back to the original CrystalPlasticityKalidindiUpdate class, with the new material properties you have in your input file, and explore the impact of slightly loosening the following tolerances:\n\nslip_increment_tolerance: the tolerance for the slip increment on each slip system. If you expect your system to have a lot of plastic deformation, the default value might be too small\nresistance_tol: the slip system resistance tolerance, for each individual slip system. If your system experiences a lot of hardening as plastic deformation occurs, you may need to increase this tolerance value\n\nThe impact of the rtol value (the tolerance for the stress residual delta to declare the stress state for the timestep as converged) within ComputeMultipleCrystalPlasticityStress may also need to be adjusted, but I would start with the two tolerance values listed above first.\nHope this helps,\nStephanie",

Both input file parameters are defined in the CrystalPlasticityStressUpdateBase class.\nDepending on the hardening behavior of your system (please see the discussion in my first post), I would recommend changing one, but not both, of the tolerance values by up-to an order-of-magnitude to see if that allows the system to converge (e.g. change the resistance_tol from the default 0.01 to 0.1). If this change allows the simulation to converge, then I would then try to tighten the tolerance back to 0.05 or 0.025. I do recommend completing this testing with the original Kalidindi model: the extra output Rank2tensors in your classes will make the simulation run slowly.\nPerforming the profiling that @GiudGiud recommended is also a good step to identify where your simulation is being slowed down.",
