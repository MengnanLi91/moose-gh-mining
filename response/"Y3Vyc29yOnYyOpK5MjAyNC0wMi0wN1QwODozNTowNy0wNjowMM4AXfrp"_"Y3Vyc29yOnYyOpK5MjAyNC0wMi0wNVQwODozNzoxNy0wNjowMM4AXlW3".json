          "bodyText": "HI all,\nI am trying to simulate dynamic fracture using RACCOON.  I started out by adapting the tutorial files for static fractures and that was working well. As my end goal is to simulate acoustic emissions I am interested nodal vibrations from dynamic fracture. As a result I have adapted the boundary conditions and mesh from the brittle fracture example as well as included the dynamic tensor mechanics master action with the aim of replicating the setup shown in figure  6 of this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huilong-Ren/publication/332063166_An_explicit_phase_field_method_for_brittle_dynamic_fracture/links/5ca47fa7458515f785203c36/An-explicit-phase-field-method-for-brittle-dynamic-fracture.pdf\nI was hoping to see nodal vibrations in response to the material fracture but the displacement curve for the marked node below the fracture zone looks smooth despite some oscillations in the velocity and elastic strain. I have included the graphs below.\nI am unsure if I am implementing the dynamics tensor mechanics master action correctly and I would be grateful If you could take a look at my input file. Could you confirm that RACCOON is compatible with the dynamic tensor mechanics kernels?\nI have also done some preliminary research into other fracture modelling methods such as XFEM and Peridynamics. Am I correct in thinking that XFEM would not work for dynamic fracture as it assumes quasi-static crack growth, solving the equilibrium equations iteratively. I have seen Peridynamics being suggested for dynamic fracture. Would this be a better option and if so what is the best way of implementing this?\nThank you\n\n\nd_elasticity.i:\nE = 32e9\nnu = 0.2\nK = '${fparse E/3/(1-2*nu)}'\nG = '${fparse E/2/(1+nu)}'\n\nGc =

Currently, the extra works I have done compared to simulation in cartesian coordinate include:\n\nSet \"coord_type = RZ\" in mesh module.\nWrite integrand (both residual and jacobian) specialized for cylindrical coordinate. For example, there is an extra term u_r / r in velocity divergence.\nHowever, as I understand, the integrand should be multiplied by r when applying integration. I want to confirm this is automatically implemented in MOOSE. May you check if I missed anything?",

So, I tried to run a very simple case: 1D wave propagation; transient.\nThe case is the following: 1D bar, Length 1m, E=200GPA, fixed on the left, loaded on the right.\n#=============-->\nI applied a sinosoidal load F(t) = 0.01sin(2pi*t), for 0<t<0.5, and ran the simulation for 1s in 100 steps.\nMy problem is the following:\nI open results in paraview, select the end point (the loaded one) and a point nead the middle of the bar. I expected a wave traveling from the left to the right, i.e. the midpoint should exhibit the same behavior as the loaded point, but with time-delay.

Therefore it is impossible to represent the internal structure of a coaxial well within.\nYou would have different options:\n\nExplicit meshing of the coaxial hole with 3D elements and various blocks that assign the material properties for the inner or outer loop. This results in a large number of elements and a fairly fine meshing.\nKeeping the GOLEM model and using the MultiApp system. Calculating the wellbore flow  and internal heat exchange in a sub-app like Thermal hydraulics and connecting it just in the bottom-most point of your borehole with the reservoir (exchange of temperature and pressure). A comparable example connecting a fracture via MultiApp is explained HERE\n\nI don't know of any example connecting PorousFlow and Thermal hydraulics.\n@GiudGiud Probably something similar with Navier-Stokes and Thermal hydraulics?\nAlso have a look at this Discussion. Even not fully solved, he uses the MultiApp approach for something similar.",
