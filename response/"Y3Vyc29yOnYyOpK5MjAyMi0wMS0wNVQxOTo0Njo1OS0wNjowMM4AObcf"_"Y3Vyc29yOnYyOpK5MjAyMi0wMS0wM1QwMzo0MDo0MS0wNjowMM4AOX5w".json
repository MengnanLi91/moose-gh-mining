Stop.\nmake[3]: Leaving directory '/home/sr2/ali.hamze/offline/moose/libmesh/build/include/libmesh'\nmake[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\nmake[2]: Leaving directory '/home/sr2/ali.hamze/offline/moose/libmesh/build/include'\nmake[1]: *** [all] Error 2\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/home/sr2/ali.hamze/offline/moose/libmesh/build/include'\nmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\n\nWhen I looked in libmesh/contrib/exodusii/, I saw there was actually no v5.22 directory, but rather a v5.22b directory. I tried renaming v5.22b to v5.22 and rerunning the update_and_rebuild_libmesh.sh script but encountered the same error.\nThe only other detail of the compilation process that I followed is that I was installing everything in place.\nHas anyone encountered and fixed this error before?\nThanks!",

That's baffling.  The symlink is part of the libMesh git repository, not even in a submodule.  If I clone libMesh, I see the symlink.  If I rm contrib/exodusii/v5.22, then git status reports the symlink as deleted in an unstaged change.  Are you on an OS or filesystem that doesn't support symbolic links?  Does find /home/sr2/ali.hamze/offline/moose/libmesh/ -type l show you any other symlinks? (either the ones in your build/ dir, or the other dozen-odd symlinks we have in contrib/ and our README, or both?)",

The interface thickness is of order sqrt(kappa/W) so it is something like 0.02. So your interface thickness is much less than the mesh spacing, which is 6/60 = 0.1. Usually you want to use at least 3 elements through the interface width, so you would need to use mesh spacing 0.0067 or something like that. Is there are a reason you're using kappa of this value?\n-I would use solve_type = PJFNK instead of NEWTON\nIn general I would suggest starting with an example input file and modifying the parameters to understand the effect better. Try varying each parameter one by one to understand the effect rather than changing everything at once. Here is a good example input file you could start from that implements a Cahn-Hilliard model using an action to populate all the kernels you need:\nmoose/modules/phase_field/examples/cahn-hilliard/Parsed_SplitCH.i\nYou may also want to look at this tutorial to understand how the different parameters of a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model affect evolution:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/moose/modules/phase_field/Tutorial.html",

I think you should have a look at unit tests too, they do exactly that.\nThis one is pretty good at defining a few things at the beginning (then it gets deep into something technical):\nhttps://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/31cb58e674a9b60d39a8f9bb82a6ad54890a34d7/unit/src/TestReconstruction.C\n For you particular case:\nI think you can skip using the AddBCAction here. See the code for this action:\nhttps://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/framework/src/actions/AddBCAction.C\nit does something very simple. You can just add the boundary condition to the problem the same way, as the unit tests do. \nnevermind you need access to the _problem\nTo help you hack the action system, you should set (in an input file, see the debug action https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/framework/src/actions/SetupDebugAction.C to do it in your case)\n[Debug]\n  show_actions = true\n  show_parser = true\n[]\n\nGuillaume",

                  "bodyText": "Hello Guilaume,\nthank you for your explanations. I had searched the unit tests already, but I didn't find any that solves a diffusion equation or something similar. I don't see, how the TestReconstruction.C shows how to add the boundary conditions?\nThe Debug actions will certainly be useful in the future, but they don't show the parameters of the actions, so that they don't help me either.\nI hope that somebody may be able to fix my example below.\nI have created a simple \"testbc\" application using stork.sh, replaced the call app->run() with my extended version of createMinimalApp(), then _action_warehouse.executeAllActions();  app->executeExecutioner();.\nI attach the full testbc app dir: testbc.zip\nAnd I paste the main.C below. Maybe my mistake, which causes the same error as mentioned initially:\n*** ERROR ***\n: missing required parameter 'right/boundary'\n\tDoc String: \"The list of boundary IDs from the mesh where this boundary condition applies\"\n: missing required parameter 'right/variable'\n\tDoc String: \"The name of the variable that this residual object operates on\"\n\nis obvious to somebody. ( If I remove the block under \"//AddBCAction\", to code runs without error an shows \"Solve Converged!\", probably because the initial zero solution is correct in that case.)\nThank you and a Happy

Since you are only using velocity in the functor, which you are correctly passing in the list of 'captures' (in [ ]), it's asking you why you are providing a pointer to the class and not using its attributes.\nHappy New Year!\nGuillaume\nPS: triple quotes work better than single quotes for paragraph of codes formatting in posts btw.",
