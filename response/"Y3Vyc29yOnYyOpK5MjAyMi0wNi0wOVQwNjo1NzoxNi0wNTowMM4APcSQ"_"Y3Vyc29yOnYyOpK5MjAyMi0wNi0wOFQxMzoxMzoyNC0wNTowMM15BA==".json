          "bodyText": "Dear,\nI am new to the moose and right now I am trying to couple the phase field and tensor mechanics to simlulate dendrite growth in elastic field. I am reading examples in the  modules/phase_field-mechanics/combined directory. I am confused about the way Moose specify the elastic tensor's dependence and strain's dependence on phase field varible.\nFor example, in the input file Conserved.i,\nFor elastic tensor, no field is reserved for the choice of phase variable in following section, but indeed elastic tensor is different across different phase field.\n\nFor strain and elastic energy, args are specified as c in the correponding section, but I cannot understand the way c interacts with strain and energy. I've read some official document on ComputeVariableEigenstrain and ElasticEnergyMaterial, but there seems to be no direct explanation.\n\nAny reponse will be highly appreciated!\nBest,\nZhigang",

For this method, I would need to have the friction angle and the cohesion in the Mohr-Coulomb model that both depend on space (given by a csv file) and time (all the Mohr-Coulomb parameters are reduced by the same factor at every time step).\nI have tried to follow the solution used in Porous Flow to produce a heterogeneous reservoir:\nhttps://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/porous_flow/heterogeneous_models.html\nThis solution does not to be directly applicable in my case as the materials properties in this example that change with space (permeability and porosity) are declared as Auxvariables and are used in a Material. However, it seems that I cannot used Auxvariables in a UserObject, which is the current way to define the Mohr-Coulomb properties. I get the following error when compiling if I try to create a Userobject that could use the Auxvariable of the friction angle:\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'coupledValue'; did you mean 'coupledScalar'?\nIt seems that only Scalar variables can be used in a UserObject.\nDo you have some ideas how I could have those parameters depending on space and time (without changing the whole return map algorithm)?\nThanks for your help!",

The parent class of all UO that defines plastic parameters is \u201cTensorMechanicsHardeningModel\u201d, which inherits from GeneralUserObject and, as you suggested, it seems to be the issue here.\nI have tried to have \u201cTensorMechanicsHardeningModel\u201d inherit from Element/Side/Interface/etcUserObject instead of GeneralUserObject, but it is creating 20 errors when compiling.\nI also tried to #include different files (like \"MooseVariable.h\" and others) directly in the UO I have created, but it didn\u2019t change anything.\nI apologise my knowledge of C++ is quite limited...\nHadrien",

I tried to familiarize myself with this function through the test example  \"cracking.i\".  The mesh file used in this example was a 1x1x1 cube with single element and the failure stress was 1.68e6 Pa.\nWhen I tried to replace the mesh file with another one, which was also a 1x1x1 cube but with more elements, the failure stress decreased. The more elements, the more the stress dropped (The failure stress was 4.17e5 Pa for 1000 elements).  I'm confused, because normally the failure stress should not change.",

The 'submodel' effectively is a cut out of the main model sharing the same spatial coordinates. It essentially acts as an RVE enforcing the strain periodicity conditions in the model. Eventually I am interested in coupling these two models together at each load step and thinking to update the deformation of the main model based on the micro-beheviour of the submodel. Just for the case of proper creation of the submodel I had to use ABAQUS for modelling the FE. However the submodel runs an empty simulation with ABAQUS input file and i am getting the following lines.\n\nsub0: Time Step 1, time = 0.01, dt = 0.01\nsub0:  0 Nonlinear |R| = 0.000000e+00\nsub0:  Solve Converged!\n\nI need to make couple of adjustments in the input file when i am using an ABAQUS mesh. The 'auto_direction' command in periodic BC is unusable and so i manually defined and matched the periodic boundaries. A nodeset consisting of a single node (node closest to centroid) created to model the reference point needed for constraining the model. The attached files could used as a reference to diagnose the problem. Any advise on fixing the problem would be highly appreciated.\n04012022.zip",

For general case, you need to use a return mapping algorithm as suggested by @hugary1995 and @ngrilli\n\nDear @jiangwen84 and @hugary1995:\nThank you for all your reply.\nAccording to the suggestion of @jiangwen84 in #18254 (reply in thread) , i read the paper by Wen Jiang et.al.  in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022311521000180 and saw the Eq.(15),\ni.e. \u03adcreep=K*( \u03c31-0.5(\u03c32+\u03c33) )*F. where K and F are parameters depending on temperature and neutron fluence, \u03c3i are the principal stresses.\nIf we want to realize the creep calculation in  Eq.(15), i am not sure whether the \"analytical expression in principal coordinate system\" mentioned by @jiangwen84 in #18254 (reply in thread) refers to  Eq.(15) and then we should transform it  to the global coordinate system.\nBesides, whether the newly created creep class still inherits from RadialReturnCreepStressUpdateBase or ComputeEigenstrainBase in MOOSE?",

While there is only three phases and 3 different values, but for n grains, the array will be n*n.\nLike M in .i file:\nM_ij = '7e-8 7e-8 7e-8 7e-8\n7e-8 7e-8 7e-8 e-6\n7e-8 7e-8 7e-8 e-6\n7e-8 e-6 e-6 7e-8'\nCould anyone give me some ideas about there coefficients?",

You can then unfold the vector in the matrix of coefficients you need in your user-code.\nWith regards to the model being complex, MOOSE can handle arbitrary numbers of variables and fully couple the equation solves. I think you will find this to be an advantage for your problem.\nI would first start with a lot of repetition in the kernels to build the system, then once you have something working and correct if you need to shorten the syntax you can look into either:\n\nusing an action to generate the system\nor\nusing array variables and array kernels to have less objects in the input file",
