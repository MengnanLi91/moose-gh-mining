Rather than using the mug.e mesh file which is provided by default, I'm trying to reproduce the figure below using a GMSH ASCII file that I created of a hollow cylinder (the .msh file is contained in here, hollow_cylinder_ascii.zip). This is the figure that I want to reproduce:\n\nThe information here on Named Entity Support (link: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/application_usage/mesh_block_type.html) has led me to believe that all I need to do is define two physical surfaces 'top' and 'bottom' that refer to the top and bottom surfaces of my cylinder. I did this in a Python script that imports the gmsh module, and you can also inspect the .msh file in hollow_cylinder_ascii.zip that these names have been implemented in lines 6 and 7 of the .msh file.\nHowever, when I attempt to run the example problem (link: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/examples/ex01_inputfile.html) with ex01.i, but changing the 'Mesh' related code to the following:\n[Mesh]\n  # This mesh file has 'top' and 'bottom' named boundaries defined inside it.\n  file = hollow_cylinder_ascii.msh\n[]\n\nI get the following error:\n*** ERROR ***\n/home/enk001/Documents/PHD/PHD-Code/projects-MOOSE/moose/examples/ex01_inputfile/ex01_cyl.i:26: (BCs/bottom/boundary):\n    the following node sets (ids) do not exist on the mesh: bottom (1)\n\napplication called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 0\n[unset]: write_line error; fd=-1 buf=:cmd=abort exitcode=1\n:\nsystem msg for write_line failure : Bad file descriptor\n\nLikewise, if I run the code with the following changes to ex01.i:\n[Mesh]\n  # This mesh file has 'top' and 'bottom' named boundaries defined inside it.\n  file = hollow_cylinder_ascii.msh\n  boundary_name = 'bottom top'\n[]\n\nI get a slightly different error:\n*** ERROR ***\nThe following error occurred in the object \"Mesh\", of type \"SetupMeshAction\".\n\nYou must supply the same number of boundary ids and names parameters\n\nStack frames: 16\n0: libMesh::print_trace(std::ostream&)\n1: moose::internal::mooseErrorRaw(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >)\n2: callMooseErrorRaw(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >&, MooseApp*)\n3: /home/enk001/Documents/PHD/PHD-Code/projects-MOOSE/moose/framework/libmoose-opt.so.0(+0xaff771) [0x773da7aff771]\n4: SetupMeshAction::setupMesh(MooseMesh*)\n5: SetupMeshAction::act()\n6: Action::timedAct()\n7: ActionWarehouse::executeActionsWithAction(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)\n8: ActionWarehouse::executeAllActions()\n9: MooseApp::runInputFile()\n10: MooseApp::run()\n11: ./ex01-opt(+0x20dc) [0x617a3052a0dc]\n12: main\n13: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6(+0x29d90) [0x773d9e629d90]\n14: __libc_start_main\n15: ./ex01-opt(+0x2386) [0x617a3052a386]\napplication called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 0\n[unset]: write_line error; fd=-1 buf=:cmd=abort exitcode=1\n:\nsystem msg for write_line failure : Bad file descriptor\n\nHere are my questions: How can I get this simple example working with a .msh (ASCII) file? I believe I've correctly labelled the top and bottom surfaces of my MSH ASCII file, and the documentation here (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/application_usage/mesh_block_type.html) suggests that MOOSE should be able to recognise this?\nThanks in advance!",

Are they using some method, such as taking the derivative of S{qp} with respect to strain?\nIn other words, is C{qp} being calculated automatically by MOOSE as a function of S{qp}?",

I am currently trying to use LinearNodalConstraint in an RBE3 type fashion, and I have something that works when I use full LU in serial, but as soon as I try and use boomeramg or other preconditioners, I can't get the solve to converge.\nI've tried three approaches. Full LU, which works, boomeramg on the whole matrix, which doesn't converge, and a field split approach where I've preconditioned the nodes involved in the nodal constraint with LU and everything else with boomeramg. The last approach of the three, instead of just not converging, results in negative jacobians. I've attached a repo which has input files for all three approaches and my testing mesh if anyone gets time to take a look. Otherwise, any tidbits of wisdom about preconditioning constrained problems would be extremely welcome:)\nhttps://github.com/TheBEllis/ConstraintProblem",
