So I think @GiudGiud's assumption of Xcode is correct. When you upgraded your MacOS version to Ventura, Mac fails to also upgrade Xcode in the process. They leave that to you (and don't tell you!). Please attempt to upgrade your Xcode (or Xcode Command Line Tools). I believe the following command may get that started:\nxcode-select --install\nIf you run into the following:\n\u276f xcode-select --install\nxcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use \"Software Update\" in System Settings to install updates\nYou'll have to use the App Store to download Xcode, in full, and proceed from there. If you do end up going this route, when the download/install is complete, be sure to launch Xcode to actually finish the installation. Heh. Xcode is so picky.",
