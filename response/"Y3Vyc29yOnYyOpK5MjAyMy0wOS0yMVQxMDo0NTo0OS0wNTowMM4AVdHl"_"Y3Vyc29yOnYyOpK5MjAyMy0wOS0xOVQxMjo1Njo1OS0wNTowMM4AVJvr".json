Is this allowed at all?\nThank you, and all the best,\nMatthew",

The following syntax explanation may help:\n#                            the Conda package to install\n#                        ///\nmamba create -n moose moose-dev\n#                ^^^ the name of the environment to create\nDid you mean to say you tried:\nmamba create -n moose moose-dev\nAnd when that didn't work (can you paste what happened at this step?), you then installed the pre-built binary:\nmamba create -n moose moose\nand then this worked (can you expand on what you mean by this worked)?\nThe Conda package moose contains the binary, or executable you can use to run simple problems, instead of having to build your own binary from source. If you have need of building your own (if you wish to develop your own MOOSE based application), you instead want to install moose-dev. This package installs everything necessary for moose development.\nYou can have both, but you should not use the same Conda environment for both. Example of installing both:\nmamba create --name moose_development moose-dev\nmamab create --name moose_binary moose\nWith two Conda environments available, you can now:\n\n\nI want to build my own special application:\nmamba activate moose_development\ncd /some/directory/my_app\nmake\n./my_app-opt -i some_input.i\n\n\nI want to just run a simple problem input file I have:\nmamba activate moose_binary\nmoose -i some_input.i\n\n\nI realize we make use of the same Conda environment name \"moose\" among our instructions. But this due to most of us only having need of one environment. You are free to create as many different Conda environment as you like!",

Then, I uninstalled the moose-dev environment and installed the moose (pre-built) environment. Testing the pre-built environment gave no errors.\nI did not override one environment with the other.\nI need the pre-built environment for now to get used to MOOSE and then I will transfer to the developer environment.

I changed the CSV and tried to recover from a checkpoint.\nThe good news is that I was able to recover and continue the simulation from the checkpoint. Good to see that it will work for this case.\nThe bad news is that the change that I made to my CSV did not affect the way that the recovered simulation ran. It still failed to solve at the same point. When I ran the input file from the beginning again, things went smoothly.\nIs recover not the right tool for me to use in this situation?",
