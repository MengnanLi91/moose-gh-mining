Now I am doing it by Paraview, which it seems not to be the best way to do it specially for big meshes. Maybe something similar to LineValueSampler which reads a csv file of lines coordinates or ElementalVariableValue if it can be extended for the entire elements. I would appreciate it if you could help me. Thanks.",
