          "bodyText": "Hello team,\nI need to calculate the total energy of the system for a phase separation in diblock copolymers. The energy function has an additional term compared to what is described here. I feel utilizing the additional_free_energy option in TotalFreeEnergy is the easiest way.\nThe additional term is of the form $$\\int_\\Omega G(x,y)(u(x)-m)dy$$. Here, both $$x$$ and $$y$$ are the position vectors not just coordinates. $$x$$ is the Quadrature point at which the integral has to be calculated to contribute to the free energy.\nNow, how can this be written most efficiently?",
