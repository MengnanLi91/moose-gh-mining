I followed the tutorial on youtube\uff08https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9plLYkAbvQ&list=TLPQMDcwNzIwMjEvnbj3LWAiyQ&index=6\uff09to do a FEM calculation of the piston, and used the correct files in the tutorial, no matter whether I updated the MOOSE and Conda in advance, my MOOSE results are as shown in the picture. Before the calculation, I have modified the Makefile, opened TENSOR_MECHANICS, and recompiled.\nI want to know how to calculate it correctly?\nThank you!",

Why then, is this not running?\nAlso, if I were to use ADParsedFunction, and created this under a \"Functions\" block, would I still be able to use it in my Material Interface?\nAlso, when retrieving this from the input file, in my material file, I have:\n_m_inf(getADMaterialPropertyByName<Real>(\"m_inf\")),\nI called it a \"Real\" since my function is real valued, is that correct?

Since you are not using conda, and are using a computing cluster where I assume someone else installed moose for you, what you need to do is specify where the MOOSE directory is before building your application. What does echo $MOOSE_DIR return?\nOnce this is fixed, we are trying to build a new executable specifically for debugging. Not really a new application.\ngdb is not tied to moose. It's used in general for debugging. You can find a lot of help on using it just by searching online. You should be good just using the command I gave you though, once you have built the application.\nGuillaume",
