Im gonna try installing conda again to fix this issue. I did see on the moose install guide that they still say conda when referring to a lot of things, which i think is a typo considering they moose now recommends a direct install of mamba.\nIs there a reason that moose now recommends directly installing mamba and not conda?",

That is, you are coupling the porous flow within your sample to some other physics that governs the fluid's physics in the atmosphere.  The rate of fluid transfer between the two obviously depends on the physics in the atmosphere.  So what is that physics?   You have to decide, and the above link gives you some suggestions.  For the type of problem that i'm often doing recently, i make a thin,  permeable layer and then use a PorousFlowOutflow BC, but in the past i've used the PorousFlowSink to good effect",

I'd like to do this as an eigenvalue problem with fission, so a problem of the form A(mu) u = lambda B(mu) u - examples like this using POD/PGD have appeared in the literature, and I've implemented it outside of MOOSE.\nI understand this is not currently available functionality - before I go too deep down the rabbit hole of trying to make modifications on my branch (and likely getting it wrong right away)... is this feasible with the current implementation/is there any advice on where to start looking to make changes/additions?

If we restart correctly, the nonlinear and linear residuals should be the same.\nWe could enable checkpoint files and restart from the previous time step for debugging. Then compare the solver behaviors of the restarted simulation with the original one at the same time step.\n\nI then take the output as an initial condition for precisely the same input file\n\n@mangerij\nWhat kind of files you restart with? Exodus or check point?",
