My problem is that the app is not running; I get the following error:\n... section '[Contact]' does not have an associated \"Action\".\nSteps sor far:\n\nI created an app using stork\nEnabled the TensorMechanics module and performed \"make\".\nI followed all steps of the TensorMechanics Tutorial - so far so good.\nI enabled the Contact module in the Makefile and performed \"make\" again. It compile without problems. (If I run make again, it makes no new compilations, so I guess that the compilation has been successful).\nI follow the Contact tutorial (https://mooseframework.inl.gov/modules/contact/tutorials/introduction/step01.html). I even copy/pasted the code to make sure that there is no typo in my code.\nI get the error mentioned above (... section '[Contact]' does not have an associated \"Action\".)\n\nFurthermore, VS Code does not recognise Contact for AutoCompletion; not even for the \"[Contact]\" (Autocomplete works fine for TensorMechanics).\nWhat am I doing wrong? How shoule I \"inform\" the app that I need a new module in my app?\nAny advice is most welcome!!\nThank you\nUpdate: I tries to \"process\" the app using peacock. I get the following warning in the console:\nWARNING\nCould not create /Contact",

(Maybe interesting is I can't get the auto-detection to work even though the translation is orthogonal. I wondered if this only works with Moose generated meshes?)\nRunning this same file with --mesh-only, then using FileMeshGenerator to load in the resulting exodus file also works fine with parallel_type = DISTRIBUTED and --distributed-mesh.\nUsing --split-mesh for either of these cases (the raw mesh file, or the --mesh-only exodus file) and loading the resulting .cpr files in FileMeshGenerator does not work. Both cases result in the error Periodic boundary neighbor not found.\n\nSo it seems that it is fine with anything where the mesh is replicated at some stage, even if parts are then deleted on each processor.

Since the translational seems to happen later than some other initial steps, this could be linked to why it is not implemented when running --mesh-only",

With a background in nuclear mechanical engineering and having been on a degree apprenticeship since 2019, I am now embarking on an exciting research project.\nBackground:\nThroughout my academic journey, I've acquired proficiency in modules like CFD, FEA, Engineering Mathematics, MATLAB, Thermofluidic Systems, Stress, and Dynamics. My focus has also extended to nuclear-centric subjects such as reactor physics, reactor chemistry, and reactor materials.\nProject Interest:\nWhile researching for my project, I came across the NEAMS framework and am intrigued by the possibility of integrating it into my work. My goal is to develop a dissertation topic centered on the use of Machine Learning (ML) or genetic algorithms to optimize a component used in a nuclear reactor.\nPreliminary Idea:\nMy initial discussion with my university supervisor has led me to consider the question: \"Can ML be used to optimize the design of (BLANK) to increase/decrease the (BLANK)?\" An example direction might be \"Utilization of Machine Learning for Heat Exchanger Optimization.\"\nPrimary Question:\nMy primary question for this community is whether ML can be implemented with the MOOSE framework. If so, who can I contact to discuss how this would work? I am eager to explore this avenue and would greatly appreciate any insights or contacts.\nRequest for Feedback:\nI would welcome any comments, suggestions, or discussions about my dissertation proposal, especially if I can align it to current research being carried out in the field. Your expertise and perspectives would be invaluable to my project.\nI look forward to your response and thank you in advance for your time and consideration.\nBest regards,\nHarry Burgess\nHBurgess173.HB@gmail.com",

I'm currently working on setting up Moose on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) following the official guidelines. However, I'm encountering issues while trying to build the Moose environment using the \"mamba create -n moose moose-dev\" command. The process fails multiple times with:\n_Looking for: ['moose-dev']\nhttps://conda.software.inl.gov/public/linux-64      ??.?MB @  ??.?MB/s 0 failed 10.0s\nDownload error (28) Timeout was reached [https://conda.software.inl.gov/public/noarch/repodata.json]\nCould not resolve host: conda.software.inl.gov_\nInterestingly, there are instances when I manage to successfully download some of the packages, but the process fails due to timeouts partway through. I'm a bit baffled by this situation since I'm in Australia and I believe there shouldn't be any restrictions on website access from my location.\nI'm hoping that someone with more experience could kindly assist me in resolving this issue. Your insights and guidance would be greatly appreciated.\nThank you,\nZinn",
