Is there any way of doing this?\nMy problem is that when the dt is 9 and I want it to change to 0.3, it does one step more with dt=9 than desired and the whole simulation is wrong, as it needs to come back to 0.3 just the step before it changes to 0.190 the init_x_coords.\nAnother possibility that I was thinking is to change the dt when a certain postprocessor reaches a threshold temperature. Is this possible? I have a postprocessor that calculates the maximum temperature in the simulation and maybe I could use it to change the TimeStepper when it reaches 320K let's say. This is the postprocessor:\n[./interpass_max_temp]\ntype = NodalExtremeValue\nvariable = temp\nvalue_type = max\n[../]\nThank you in advance for your help",

I wanted to know if we can give our properties to moose? For example instead of using predefined Capillary Pressure functions i. e. constant, VG, BC, etc., we give a csv file containing CP vs saturation. Thanks.\nBest regards,\nSina",
