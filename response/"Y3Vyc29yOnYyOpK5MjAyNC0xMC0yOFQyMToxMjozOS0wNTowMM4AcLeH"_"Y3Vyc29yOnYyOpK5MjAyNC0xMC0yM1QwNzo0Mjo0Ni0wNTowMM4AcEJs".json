          "bodyText": "Hi all,\nI have a problem which I have encountered in the past that is coming up again. I use gmsh for meshing.\nWhen I create a 2D mesh, and define 1D physical groups (lines), MOOSE is able to recognize those lines as boundaries and do things like apply Neumann conditions, use VectorPostProcessors like SideValueSampler, etc.\nHowever, when I create a 3D mesh and define 1D physical groups, I get the error:\n(VectorPostprocessors/upper_right_z_disp/boundary):\n    the following side sets (ids) do not exist on the mesh: sample_location (19)\n\n    MOOSE distinguishes between \"node sets\" and \"side sets\" depending on whether\n    you are using \"Nodal\" or \"Integrated\" BCs respectively. Node sets corresponding\n    to your side sets are constructed for you by default.\n\n    Try setting \"Mesh/construct_side_list_from_node_list=true\" if you see this error.\n    Note: If you are running with adaptivity you should prefer using side sets.\n\nThis only shows up for 1D physical groups. 2D physical groups/boundaries work fine. Also, \"construct_side_list_from_node_list=true\" does not change anything.\nBased off of this behavior, If I understand correctly, the way it works is that \"sides\" can only be 1 dimension less than the dimension of the mesh. But then what do I do if I want to apply a line load on a 3D mesh? Or in my case (reason for making this post), sample a value along a curved line? LineValueSampler can't work for me there because that can only define straight lines.\nInterestingly enough, a 0D physical group had no issues applying a Dirichlet BC.\nI saw this answer #24174 from @jwpeterson , where it was suggested to add \"lower_dimensional_block\" to my mesh file, so I went ahead and did:\n$MeshFormat\n4.1 0 8\n$EndMeshFormat\n$PhysicalNames\n2\n0 18 \"loading_point\"\n1 19 \"sample_location\" lower_dimensional_block\n$EndPhysicalNames\n$Entities\n7 12 8 1\n1 0 0 0 0 \n2 0 0.002 0 0 \n3 0 -0.002 0 0 \n4 0 0 0.002 1 18 \n5 0 0 -0.002 0 \n6 0.002 0 0 0 \n7 -0.002 0 0 0 \n1 -6.389406329081476e-05 -6.389406329081475e-05 -6.389406329081475e-05 6.389406329081476e-05 0.002063894063290815 0.002063894063290815 0 2 4 -2 \n2 -2.334153974494834e-05 -2.334153974494803e-05 -0.002023341539744949 2.334153974494834e-05 0.002023341539744949 2.334153974494846e-05 0 2 2 -5 \n\n\nbut nothing changed. How can I fix this so I can sample points along a curved line in 3D? I attached here my gmsh file, a simple sphere, and I want to sample the value of the displacement along a curved line on the surface from the top to the right side.\n// Gmsh project created on Wed Oct 16 19:47:43 2024\nSetFactory(\"OpenCASCADE\");\n//+\nPoint(1) = {0, 0, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(2) = {0, 0.002, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(3) = {0, -0.002, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(4) = {0, 0, 0.002, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(5) = {0, 0, -0.002, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(6) = {0.002, 0, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nPoint(7) = {-0.002, 0, 0, 0.00005};\n//+\nCircle(1) = {4, 1, 2};\n//+\nCircle(2) = {2, 1, 5};\n//+\nCircle(3) = {6, 1, 2};\n//+\nCircle(4) = {2, 1, 7};\n//+\nCircle(5) = {4, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(6) = {5, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(7) = {6, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(8) = {7, 1, 3};\n//+\nCircle(9) = {4, 1, 7};\n//+\nCircle(10) = {4, 1, 6};\n//+\nCircle(11) = {6, 1, 5};\n//+\nCircle(12) = {5, 1, 7};\n//+\nCurve Loop(2) = {1, -3, -10};\n//+\nSurface(1) = {2};\n//+\nCurve Loop(4) = {9, -4, -1};\n//+\nSurface(2) = {4};\n//+\nCurve Loop(6) = {2, -11, 3};\n//+\nSurface(3) = {6};\n//+\nCurve Loop(8) = {2, 12, -4};\n//+\nSurface(4) = {8};\n//+\nCurve Loop(10) = {5, -7, -10};\n//+\nSurface(5) = {10};\n//+\nCurve Loop(12) = {7, -6, -11};\n//+\nSurface(6) = {12};\n//+\nCurve Loop(14) = {6, -8, -12};\n//+\nSurface(7) = {14};\n//+\nCurve Loop(16) = {5, -8, -9};\n//+\nSurface(8) = {16};\n//+\nSurface Loop(1) = {7, 6, 5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 8};\n//+\nVolume(1) = {1};\n//+\nSurface Loop(2) = {5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8};\n//+\nPhysical Point(\"loading_point\", 18) = {4};\n//+\nPhysical Curve(\"sample_location\", 19) = {10};",

Converting to a discussion.\nIt looks as though the company, or organization you are with, blocks your access to https://github.com (and probably all outbound sites via the terminal), by means of first requiring you to use their ROOT Certificates. Just like us, here at INL. This is basically so they can watch what you're doing (which is called an MITM attack, if it were an actual threat actor). Stating this, just in case you are actually falling victim to an MITM... Please look into this, if you are in fact using a personal machine.\nI see this error when one does not have their certificates properly set up.\nUnfortunately, there is nothing anyone here can do to help you other than your own organization's network team. They should be providing you with the certificates, and how to enable them within your terminal. If you know what you are doing you should be able to extrapolate what your favorite web browser is doing when navigating to https://github.com, and extract that certificate to somewhere on your drive, and export a few influential environment variables to let git know where they are. My exact setup to show you what those environment variables are:\n\u276f env | grep -i root\nREQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/certs/CAINLROOT.crt\nSSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/certs/CAINLROOT.crt\nCURL_CA_BUNDLE=/opt/certs/CAINLROOT.crt\nYour network team should be providing you with the *.crt file. Anyways... One work-around that might work, and should not be considered a \"fix\" or used for extended amounts of time, is to bypass SSL verification temporarily:\nGIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git clone https://github.com/idaholab/moose\nThis effectually turns off SSL protections. The errors you are seeing are actually \"good\" errors. The program is trying to alert to you something is wrong with your secure connection. That there isn't one!\nThe other thing you can do is to not use HTTPs protocol, and instead create an SSH public/private key pair, and clone MOOSE that way: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent\nUsing SSH is the preferred way to clone MOOSE anyway, if you plan on making changes and commiting them back MOOSE.",
