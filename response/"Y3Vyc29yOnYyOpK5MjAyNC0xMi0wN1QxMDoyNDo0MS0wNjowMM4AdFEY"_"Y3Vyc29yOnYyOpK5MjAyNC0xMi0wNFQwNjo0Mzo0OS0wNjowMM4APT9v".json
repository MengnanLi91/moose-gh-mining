But this feels a little unnecessary and adds some complexity to the model I'd like to avoid.\nFurthermore, other boundary conditions (e.g. DirichletBC) will not produce any problems even if the boundary (or parts of it) they live on is re-assigned to an 'inactive' subdomain.\nI'd tried to understand what exactly is the problem for Moose but did not succeed. It is even unclear to me if this is a problem in Moose or in libmesh.\nCould you please comment on this behaviour:\n\nIs this a problem in Moose or in libmesh?\nShould Moose avoid this message/error? I am in favour of \u2018yes\u2019. But if no, then Moose should also fail to converge in OPT-mode.\nIf Moose should avoid this message/error: What has to be changed to do so?\n\nThanks in advance!\nPlease find a simple test-model below (run-time should be fast)\ninput-file\n\nThis model will fail in DBG-mode.

For non-RANS models (just using simple mass, momentum, and heat transfers), the Newton algorithm seemed to be working, but once I added in TKE and TKED variables and kernels, it gave me the error\nFor iteration type 'nonlinear': solution state 1 was requested in nl0 but only up to state 0 is available.\n\nAnd it looks like the error is being given by the INSFVTKESourceSink object. Are Newton capabilities not implemented for the k-epsilon model yet? Or is there a work-around that I have not found?\nI've seen the SIMPLE algorithm, and I could probably work with it, but it would be nice to work with what I'm familiar with.\nAny ideas on where to go with this?\nThanks!\nCharlie\nAdditional information\nNo response",

I see the same issue when when the diffusivity(CH mobility) is dependent on the conserved(rho) and non-conserved(eta) phase field variables. The simulation diverges with huge vibrations in the solution of rho. When I simplify the diffusivity to a constant (D=1), the solution is fine and no more vibration in the end.\nD dependent on etas and rho, tstep=1\n\nD dependent on etas and rho, tstep=63\n\ninput file used attached\ninput.txt.txt\nD=1 constant, tstep=2400\n\nI am suspecting maybe the element order is not high enough, or mesh is not refined enough for the phase field variables? Any help or discussion is welcomed. Thank you.",

I used (3c^2-2c^3)(1-3c^2-2c^3)D_surf in the mobility and it works fine so far. Mobility constants are picked similar scale to the paper.",
